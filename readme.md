# About this repo

- Study the most basic form of ddpm model. Main Reference: [Diffusion models from scratch in PyTorch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Yfz2FxXiY&fbclid=IwAR14YaOBTAwTp_mmp_Q5MALMRuecTxDLUwcTAESifcB8IlqpmFYDy_IlnV4).
- I just try to debug and run the training process to understand the code base more deeply.
- You can download the standford car training data from pytorch builtin command, I have made my own dataset pipeline in `standford_cars/dataset.py`.
- Since the code is relatively simple, I have condensed everything into a single main.py. The code mainly comes from the [Diffusion models from scratch in PyTorch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Yfz2FxXiY&fbclid=IwAR14YaOBTAwTp_mmp_Q5MALMRuecTxDLUwcTAESifcB8IlqpmFYDy_IlnV4) video.
- The key takeaways I have in the course of study are summarized in [my blog post](https://machingclee.github.io/blog/Diffusion-Model-Study)
